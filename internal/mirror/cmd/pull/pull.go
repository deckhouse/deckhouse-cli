const pullLong = `Download Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform distribution to the local filesystem.
		
This command downloads the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform distribution bundle 
containing specific platform releases and it's modules, 
to be pushed into the air-gapped container registry at a later time.

For more information on how to use it, consult the docs at 
https://deckhouse.io/products/kubernetes-platform/documentation/v1/deckhouse-faq.html#manually-uploading-images-to-an-air-gapped-registry

Additional configuration options for the d8 mirror family of commands are available as environment variables:

 * $SSL_CERT_FILE           — Path to the SSL certificate. If the variable is set, system certificates are not used;
 * $SSL_CERT_DIR            — List of directories to search for SSL certificate files, separated by a colon.
                              If set, system certificates are not used. More info at https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man1/c_rehash/;
 * $HTTP_PROXY/$HTTPS_PROXY — URL of the proxy server for HTTP(S) requests to hosts that are not listed in the $NO_PROXY;
 * $NO_PROXY                — Comma-separated list of hosts to exclude from proxying.
                              Supported value formats include IP's', CIDR notations (1.2.3.4/8), domains, and asterisk sign (*).
                              The IP addresses and domain names can also include a literal port number (1.2.3.4:80).
                              The domain name matches that name and all the subdomains.
                              The domain name with a leading . matches subdomains only.
                              For example, foo.com matches foo.com and bar.foo.com; .y.com matches x.y.com but does not match y.com.
                              A single asterisk * indicates that no proxying should be done;
