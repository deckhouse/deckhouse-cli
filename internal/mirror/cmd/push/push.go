const pushLong = `Upload Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform distribution bundle to the third-party registry.

This command pushes the Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform distribution into the specified container registry.

For more information on how to use it, consult the docs at 
https://deckhouse.io/products/kubernetes-platform/documentation/v1/deckhouse-faq.html#manually-uploading-images-to-an-air-gapped-registry

Additional configuration options for the d8 mirror family of commands are available as environment variables:

 * $SSL_CERT_FILE           — Path to the SSL certificate. If the variable is set, system certificates are not used;
 * $SSL_CERT_DIR            — List of directories to search for SSL certificate files, separated by a colon.
                              If set, system certificates are not used. More info at https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man1/c_rehash/;
 * $HTTP_PROXY/$HTTPS_PROXY — URL of the proxy server for HTTP(S) requests to hosts that are not listed in the $NO_PROXY;
 * $NO_PROXY                — Comma-separated list of hosts to exclude from proxying.
                              Supported value formats include IP's', CIDR notations (1.2.3.4/8), domains, and asterisk sign (*).
                              The IP addresses and domain names can also include a literal port number (1.2.3.4:80).
                              The domain name matches that name and all the subdomains.
                              The domain name with a leading . matches subdomains only.
                              For example, foo.com matches foo.com and bar.foo.com; .y.com matches x.y.com but does not match y.com.
                              A single asterisk * indicates that no proxying should be done;

The d8 mirror functionality is exclusively available to users holding a
